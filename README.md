# NoteWorm üìù
CS280 Intro to UX/UI and Interaction Design project. <br/>
Theme: Note-taking app <br/>
Designed using Balsamiq.

### The project
`NoteWorm` is a mobile note-taking app designed for students who need to digitise their way of studying. If you are those who want to get away from the physical clutter of books and the smell of paper, then this is the app for you! 

- `Reasearch_Features_Sketch.pdf`: containing my research on what is a note-taking app, considered features, and hand drawn sketches showing my designs. 
- `Persona.pdf`: my persona representing my users, outling who they are and how do they represent the users that will use my app. 
- `Scenario.pdf`: the user story of my persona, explaining why they need this app, how they've come to this app and why it solves their problem.
- `Self-Reflection`: explaining what my original wireframe lacked and what design/ feature re-improvements I have done in my improved low-fi wireframe.
- `Wireframes`: folder containing my first wireframe and my improved one.
- `PDF files`: folder containig the clickable PDF forms of my 2 wireframes. 

### The Criteria
- Conduct online research on existing apps and identify key features.
- Develop a realistic scenario and persona of the most typical user of the mobile app.
- Prepare quick hand-drawn sketches of your app design.
- Create fully clickable, low fidelity wireframes of your proposed design.
- Reflect and re-improve your design from feedback received from peers.
